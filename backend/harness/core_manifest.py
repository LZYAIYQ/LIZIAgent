"""Core vs user-extension classification policy for the harness layer.

The harness presents a curated, *user-facing* view of the agent's
capabilities. Built-in tools, bundled skills, and YAML-declared MCP
servers are considered **core** and are hidden from this view:

* The user cannot list them via the harness inventory API.
* The user cannot remove them via the harness extension lifecycle.
* The agent still has full access to them internally.

Anything the user explicitly added at runtime is a **user extension**:

* MCP servers added via ``mcp_manage`` / ``POST /api/mcp/servers``.
* Skills authored via ``skill_manage`` and not on the curated core list.
* Plugins loaded from ``workspace/plugins``.

The policy is intentionally simple and conservative. Phase 1 errs on
the side of hiding rather than exposing: any unrecognized built-in
tool is treated as core. Future phases may relax this once the
inventory schema is stable.

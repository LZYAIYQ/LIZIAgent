"""Tool / phase → user-facing ping label mapping.

This module is plain data; importing it has no side effects. The
:class:`ProgressEmitter` consults these tables to decide what to say
(and whether to say anything) when a tool starts or a turn enters a
named phase.

Conventions:
- Labels are short Chinese strings with a single leading emoji.
- ``None`` means "stay silent" for that tool / phase — used for
  ultra-internal tools (``tool_search``) and tools whose name is too
  noisy to surface (``delegate``).
- MCP tools always carry the ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` prefix; the
  emitter falls back to a generic label so install-new MCP servers
  light up automatically without needing to update this map.

"""Built-in tools shipped with LZAgent.

These are the initial safe primitives the agent uses out of the box. They are
designed to be useful in isolation (each one resolves a question end-to-end
from minimal inputs) and to compose well (``web_search`` discovers URLs that
``read_url`` can then fetch; ``read_file`` gives the agent grounded access to
its own workspace artifacts).

"""delegate_tool: hand a complex sub-task off to an isolated sub-agent.

See :mod:`backend.agent.delegation` for the runner. This module is the
thin tool facade that exposes ``delegate(task=...)`` to the LLM and
gates it through the v0.6 confirmation flow.

Why is delegate confirm-tier? — Two reasons:

1. **Cost transparency.** The sub-agent has its own iteration budget;
   approving the delegate means agreeing to spend that budget. Putting
   it behind a yes/no makes the user aware.
2. **Surprise prevention.** A delegate often kicks off a multi-second
   work chain. Confirming first guarantees the user stays oriented; the
   bot doesn't disappear into "thinking" with no user-visible signal.

The tool is **not** lazy: the moment the user says yes, the sub-agent
runs synchronously inside the loop and returns its result. There is no
async fire-and-forget here (unlike the v0.9 review fork) — the parent
agent NEEDS the result to continue its turn.

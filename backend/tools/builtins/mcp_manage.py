"""mcp_manage: agent-managed MCP server attachment (confirm tier, v0.33+).

This is the IM-facing entry point that turns LZAgent into a real plugin
platform: any MCP server reachable from the host can be attached at
runtime without editing YAML or restarting. The tool wraps four layers:

1. :class:`backend.mcp.installer` — install the package
   binary itself (``npm install -g`` / ``pip install --user`` /
   ``uv tool install``) so a stdio command can resolve on PATH.
2. :class:`backend.mcp.manager.MCPManager.add_server` /
   :meth:`remove_server` — manage in-process connection lifecycle.
3. :class:`backend.tools.registry.ToolRegistry` — register / unregister
   the discovered tool wrappers so the agent can immediately call them
   on the next turn.
4. :class:`backend.mcp.store.MCPServerStore` — persist the runtime
   registration into SQLite so the new server survives a restart.

Read-only actions (``list``, ``inspect``, ``installed``) are exempt
from the confirm prompt via :meth:`is_action_read_only`. Mutating
actions (``add``, ``remove``, ``reconnect``, ``install``, ``promote``)
all go through ``permission=confirm`` because they change process
state (spawning subprocesses, opening sockets, downloading code from
public registries, exposing new tools to the LLM).

Actions:

* ``list``       no args — summary of every registered server.
* ``add``        name + transport + (command|url) — attach a new server.
* ``remove``     name — detach a runtime-registered server.
* ``reconnect``  name — bounce one server's connection (re-discover tools).
* ``inspect``    name — full status + advertised tools for one server.
* ``install``    package_manager + package — fetch the binary so a
                 follow-up ``add`` finds it on PATH.
* ``installed``  package_manager — list packages already installed
                 in the managed prefix (v1.1.0, read-only).
* ``promote``    name + (tool_name | tool_pattern) + permission —
                 flip individual tools' permission tier so query-only
                 servers stop asking confirm on every call.

Naming uses the existing ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` convention enforced by
:func:`backend.mcp.tool_wrapper.make_qualified_tool_name`.

        " ``filesystem``, ``time``, ``slack`` are Python and only on PyPI.\n"

        " on a registry yet (rare; reserve for fresh GitHub-only releases).\n"
        "  • If install fails with ``Python 3.x not found`` or"
        " ``ImportError`` on a hyphenated package, the package is Python"
        " — retry with ``package_manager='pip'``. If install fails with"

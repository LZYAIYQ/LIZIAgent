"""read_file: safely read a UTF-8 text file from within the agent workspace.

Security model (minimal but strict):

* Paths are **relative** to the configured workspace root. Absolute paths,
  paths containing ``..``, and paths that resolve outside the root after
  symlink expansion are all refused.
* Binary files are refused by a cheap NUL-byte heuristic in the first 1 KiB;
  this keeps the LLM from ingesting binary blobs that would burn tokens and
  produce garbage.
* Size is capped at 256 KiB; larger files are truncated with a visible
  marker so the LLM knows it is not seeing the whole thing.

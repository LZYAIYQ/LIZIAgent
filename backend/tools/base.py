"""Tool protocol primitives and result/permission types.

Tools are plain Python classes (not ABCs — abstract classvars add more friction
than they prevent). Subclasses override the class-level ``name`` /
``description`` / ``permission`` / ``parameters_schema`` attributes and
implement the async ``execute()`` coroutine.

``ToolPermission`` encodes the v0.5 trust model:

* ``SAFE``    — read-only side effects; registry executes immediately.
* ``CONFIRM`` — mutating or externally-visible action; registry refuses in v0.5
                (the confirmation broker lands in v0.6). These tools are also
                omitted from the LLM-facing schema by default so the model does
                not waste tokens trying to call something that will be denied.
* ``DENY``    — never allowed. Registered tools with this tier are dropped at
                ``register()`` time so they cannot be invoked at all.

"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) client subsystem.

Connects to external MCP servers via stdio, discovers their tools, and
registers each one into the LZAgent ``ToolRegistry`` so the agent can call
them like any built-in tool.

Three big simplifications vs Hermes' ``tools/mcp_tool.py``:

* No background asyncio loop in a thread — LZAgent is async-native, so we
  ``await`` the MCP SDK directly.
* No OAuth for env-interpolated bearer headers cover most practical
  remote servers; OAuth lands in a later milestone.
* No server-initiated sampling for the agent is the LLM caller,
  not the LLM provider.

Public exports come from the submodules; ``app.py`` only cares about
``MCPManager``.

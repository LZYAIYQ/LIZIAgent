"""Pre-script runner for cron jobs.

Some cron-driven skills are *data-bound* — "summarise today's arxiv",
"alert when CPU > 80%", "tell me what changed in repo X" — and asking
the LLM to produce that data from thin air is a recipe for hallucination.
Hermes Agent solves this with a ``pre_script`` field on each cron job:
just before the LLM is invoked the script is exec'd, its stdout is
spliced into the user-side instruction as ground-truth context, and the
LLM only formats / summarises.

This module is the LZAgent equivalent. Design constraints:

* **Scoped to the workspace**: the script path must resolve under
  ``settings.workspace_dir``. We refuse absolute paths and any traversal
  that escapes the workspace (``../`` etc.). This is the same threat
  model as ``read_file`` / ``write_file``.
* **Extension allowlist**: ``.py`` and ``.sh`` only. Stops the LLM (or a
  poorly-validated API client) from registering a job that runs an
  arbitrary binary.
* **Bounded timeout**: a misbehaving script that hangs forever can't take
  down the cron loop because we wrap the call in
  :func:`asyncio.wait_for` and fall back to ``[LZAgent pre_script
  timeout]`` text on expiry.
* **Bounded stdout**: at most :data:`MAX_STDOUT_BYTES` are captured, so
  a runaway data dump can't blow out the LLM's context window.

The runner returns a small dataclass instead of a bare string so the
caller (``run_cron_job`` in ``app.py``) can include status + execution
time in its log line and surface failures to the user via the
``last_error`` column.

"""rich content / structured cards across IM platforms.

The agent layer produces a single :class:`RichMessage` ; per-gateway
renderers convert it to the best representation that the underlying
channel supports (e.g. wecom_bot's ``markdown`` msgtype, weixin's
plain-text-with-aligned-tables, etc).

See ``schema.py`` for the data model and ``parser.py`` for the
fence-based LLM extractor.

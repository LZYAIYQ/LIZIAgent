"""Extract :class:`RichMessage` from LLM markdown output.

A skill that opts into ``rich_output`` instructs the LLM to wrap its
structured payload in a fenced block tagged ``rich-content``; the
surrounding text becomes the fallback (plain-text) representation::

    Looking at your itinerary I'd suggest…

    ```rich-content
    {
      "title": "杭州 3 天行程",
      "blocks": [
        {"kind": "kv", "title": "去程", "pairs": [
          ["车次", "G225"],
          ["时间", "上海虹桥 09:00 → 杭州东 09:45"]
        ]}
      ]
    }
    ```

    所以这趟早上出发完全来得及。

The parser pulls the JSON block out, leaves the rest of the message as
the fallback, and silently degrades on any failure (bad JSON, missing
fields, fence not present) — the original markdown then becomes the
plain-text answer. This "fail open" behaviour matches the agent's
philosophy: never lose the answer to a parsing bug.

Why not arbitrary JSON, why a fence
-----------------------------------

Letting the LLM emit raw JSON forces every model to produce *only*
JSON — that breaks fluent narrative answers and trips on stray
Chinese punctuation inside string fields. A code fence is the most
reliable separator OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / Qwen models all
respect; the language tag (``rich-content``) is unique enough to not
collide with code samples a tool result might contain.

Multiple fences
---------------

If the LLM emits more than one ``rich-content`` fence we currently
keep the *first* (with a debug log). Future expansion (e.g. multi-card
conversations) can change this; for now it would surprise the user to
see the cards out of authoring order.

Streaming compatibility
-----------------------

The parser only runs on the *complete* assistant message (after the
LLM finishes), so it does not interact with v0.37.9 token streaming.
Skills that opt into rich_output should also disable per-token
streaming for that turn (otherwise the user briefly sees raw JSON
mid-stream). The agent loop wires this gate.

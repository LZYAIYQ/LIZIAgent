"""Write-origin provenance primitive (ContextVar-based).

Tracks who initiated the current write — a foreground user request
or a background self-review fork. Used by:

* ``agent/loop.py`` to mark the review fork's writes.
* ``skills/guard.py`` to relax policy on user-initiated writes.
* ``skills/history.py`` to record the actor in the history JSONL.
* ``tools/builtins/skill_manage.py`` to tag ``created_by`` on
  skill records.

Belongs to the core layer: ContextVar primitive with no upward
dependencies. Previously lived in ``agent/skill_provenance.py``
but the agent does not own the concept — it's a shared marker
that multiple subsystems read.

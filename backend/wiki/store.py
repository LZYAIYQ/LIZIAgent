"""SQLite-backed answer cache (the "wiki").

Storage layer only — no business rules, no normalization decisions
(those live in :mod:`backend.wiki.normalizer`), no router glue (that
lives in ``backend/agent/loop.py``). Mirrors the
``MemoryStore``/``MemoryManager`` separation: this class can be
unit-tested in isolation and a future swap to a vector backend
changes ``lookup()`` only.

Design choices
--------------
* **Stateless.** Every method opens its own ``session_scope``. Safe
  to share one instance across coroutines, no locking required.
* **Skill-scoped.** All queries filter on ``skill_id`` so removing a
  skill (or renaming it) lets us invalidate its rows in a single
  ``DELETE WHERE skill_id=?``.
* **No partial-row updates from the hit path.** The hit-counter
  bump runs in its own transaction so a slow read elsewhere can't
  hold a write lock on the cache.
* **Lookup is two-phase.** First an exact match on the normalized
  query (the common case — cheap O(log n) index seek). On miss, a
  bounded-substring fallback (LIKE %q%) handles the case where the
  user phrases the query slightly longer than the cached form.
  Substring matches are scored by length-ratio so a stored
  "北京 3日" beats a stored "北京 3日 美食 推荐" when the user types
  "北京 3日游" — closer length wins.

        Returns the new entry's ``id``. Empty / invalid inputs raise

        when an entry already exists for the same

        DIFFERENT from the new ``answer``, the OLD row is kept but
        marked ``superseded_by=<new_id>``. The lookup path skips
        superseded rows by default, so the user-visible behaviour is
        identical to a replace, but the historical record survives
        for the REST audit surface and for future supersession-
        chain analysis ("this fact has been corrected 3 times in 6

        ``confidence`` initial values 0.4-0.7 set by the

"""query normalization for the answer cache.

Why a normalizer at all
=======================
Two paraphrases of the same intent must converge to the same cache
key — otherwise the wiki misses on every variation and the whole
"first slow, then instant" promise falls apart. A real semantic
embedding would solve this, but for v0.37 we use deterministic
text rewrites that handle the high-leverage cases:

* "我想去北京玩三天" → ``北京 3日``
* "北京三日游攻略" → ``北京 3日``
* "去北京 3天怎么安排" → ``北京 3日``

Generic rules apply to all skills (``normalize_query``); per-skill
rules layer on top via ``normalize_for_kind`` so a future
``weather`` skill can canonicalize "上海" / "魔都" / "Shanghai" to
the same key without polluting the travel rules.

Iron law: normalization MUST be idempotent. ``normalize(normalize(x))
== normalize(x)`` for every input. The cache writer and the cache
reader run the same function — if normalization isn't a fixed point
we silently double-rewrite on writes and never find rows on reads.
The smoke block has an explicit assertion for this.

"""Strip hallucinated XML/DSML tool-call attempts from LLM content.

Some providers (DeepSeek V4 Pro observed in 2026-05) emit tool-call
intents as XML or DSML-style text inside the ``content`` field
instead of using the structured ``tool_calls`` field required by the
OpenAI Chat Completions protocol. LZAgent's streaming defence only
watches ``delta.tool_calls``, so those hallucinated XML blocks leak
straight into the user-facing IM message and look like garbage:

    < | | DSML | | tool_calls> < | | DSML | | invoke name="read_url">
    < | | DSML | | parameter name="url" string="true">https://...

This module provides two pure-function primitives the LLM client
uses to defuse that failure mode without depending on any AgentLoop
state:

* :func:`contains_hallucinated_tool_call` — cheap substring test.
  Used by the streaming dispatcher to STOP forwarding ``content``
  deltas to the IM gateway the instant the buffered text crosses
  into XML hallucination. The user keeps whatever legitimate
  narration was flushed before the XML began; nothing new appears.

* :func:`strip_hallucinated_tool_calls` — regex-based block removal.
  Applied to the final aggregated ``content`` before it leaves the
  LLM client, so the AgentLoop sees a clean assistant message even
  when the wire response was contaminated. The function preserves
  legitimate prose interleaved between XML blocks (some providers
  alternate narration + fake tool call + narration; we want to keep
  rounds 1 and 3 and drop round 2).

False-positive risk is low: the token ``DSML`` is unique enough that
it is not expected in legitimate user-facing text. The XML pattern
requires multiple structural tokens to co-occur, which makes a stray
``<parameter`` inside a Markdown code block safe.

#   non-greedy across them so two separate blocks don't collapse).
#
# * ``<function_calls>``-style: Claude Sonnet's documented XML
#   format. Captured as a balanced tag for symmetry with the
#   ``DSML`` case. Some hallucinations forget the closing tag, so we

class StreamingHallucinationScrubber:
    """Stateful streaming scrubber that survives chunk boundaries.

    The one-shot :func:`contains_hallucinated_tool_call` substring test
    cannot defuse the leak when the tripwire token (``DSML`` or
    ``<function_calls>``) is split across deltas. Real example from
    DeepSeek V4 Pro logs:

        chunk 1: ``< | | ``
        chunk 2: ``DSML | |``
        chunk 3: `` tool_calls>``

    The one-shot detector only fires on chunk 3; chunks 1 and 2 already
    flushed to the IM gateway, so the user sees `< | | DSML | |` flicker
    in before the rest gets suppressed.

    This scrubber keeps a small **suspicion tail** that could be the
    start of a tripwire. Once we're certain the tail is NOT the start
    of a tripwire (e.g. the next char makes the prefix impossible), it
    flushes out. Once it IS confirmed a tripwire, the scrubber
    permanently latches and drops everything afterwards.

    Usage::

        scrubber = StreamingHallucinationScrubber()
        for delta in stream:
            visible = scrubber.feed(delta)
            if visible:

        # End-of-stream: any tail that's safely non-tripwire flushes.
        tail = scrubber.flush()

    each new streaming response.

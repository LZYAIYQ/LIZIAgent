"""Per-turn context exposed to tools via :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`.

Background
----------
Some tools — most notably ``cron_manage`` — need to know *who* the
current turn is talking to so they can default things like the cron job's
delivery target back to "the chat the user is currently messaging from".
Hermes Agent solves this by stuffing ``HERMES_SESSION_PLATFORM`` /
``HERMES_SESSION_CHAT_ID`` into a process env scope; we use Python's
:mod:`contextvars` because we already run as a single asyncio process and
this scopes cleanly per coroutine without polluting the global env.

Usage
-----
:class:`backend.agent.loop.AgentLoop` sets the context at the very top of
each :meth:`run_turn` call (via :func:`set_turn_context`) and resets it on
exit. Tools that *need* the context import :func:`current_turn_context`
and treat ``None`` as "no IM session is currently active" (e.g. an offline
smoke test driving the tool directly).

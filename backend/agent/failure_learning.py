"""Failure-pattern tracker — turns recurring tool errors into agent_notes.

Background
----------
After a few months of use, an agent will hit the same surprising error
over and over: the arxiv API returning 429 because we hit it too fast,
``read_url`` failing on a domain that requires a User-Agent header,
``cron_manage`` rejecting a name that has uppercase letters. Each
individual recovery is fine — the LLM apologises and retries — but the
n-th identical recovery is a sign the *agent* is the one needing to
remember.

This module is the lightweight bookkeeper that watches every turn for
``ok=False`` tool calls, fingerprints the failure (tool name + a stable
hash of the error string), increments a counter, and once the same
fingerprint crosses :data:`DEFAULT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` it surfaces a
proactive proposal — currently a log line + a row in the
:class:`backend.memory.store.MemoryStore` so the v0.9 review fork (or
the operator) sees it next time.

Design choices

* **Best-effort, never raising.** The agent loop calls
  :meth:`FailureLearner.observe_turn` after every turn; that call wraps
  every operation in try/except so an exception in the bookkeeper never
  cascades into the user-facing turn.
* **Fingerprint-then-count.** We don't store every failure, just the
  *number* of times each fingerprint has fired. A fingerprint is
  ``(tool_name, normalised_error_signature)`` — see
  :func:`fingerprint_error`.
* **One pass per turn.** Even if a turn fires 5 retries of the same
  tool, this counts as 1 occurrence — we want "shows up across N turns",
  not "5 retries in one go".
* **Auto-write to memory only on the first crossing.** The threshold is
  inclusive: the **first** time a fingerprint hits N, we write
  exactly one ``agent_note``. Future occurrences of the same fingerprint
  are ignored from the auto-write path; the note already exists. The
  curator can dedupe / archive if needed.
* **v0.45 persistence.** Optionally pass a ``state_path``; the
  bookkeeper then loads its counters on startup and re-saves them
  best-effort on every threshold-relevant bump. Without a state_path
  the tracker stays in-memory exactly like v0.13.

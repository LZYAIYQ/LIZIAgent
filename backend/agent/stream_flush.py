"""Token-level streaming dispatch helper.

The agent loop hands a :class:`StreamFlusher` to ``LLMClient.chat`` as a
``stream_callback`` while a final, no-tools LLM call is in flight. The
flusher accumulates ``content`` deltas and dispatches partial
``OutgoingMessage`` chunks to the IM gateway as soon as either of two
thresholds is hit:

* **flush_chars** — buffered characters reach this many. Default 200.
  Smaller floods IM rate-limits; larger defeats the typing-effect.

* **flush_interval_ms** — milliseconds since the last flush exceed this
  AND we already have at least ``min_chars`` characters in the buffer.
  Default 1500 ms / 80 chars. The min-chars floor stops the very first
  token from being sent solo (most providers emit single Chinese
  characters one at a time, and 80 chars is roughly one short
  paragraph — a reasonable atomic unit on微信).

Why a separate class
--------------------

* Keeps :mod:`backend.llm.openai_compatible` ignorant of IM concerns;
  it just calls ``await stream_callback(text)`` per chunk.
* Encapsulates the multi-message rate-limiting math so the agent loop
  stays readable.
* Holds the full aggregated text so the caller can still write the
  result into the wiki cache + memory + return it as the loop outcome
  (``None`` final_text would defeat both downstream consumers).

Design choices
--------------

* **Multi-message dispatch, not edit-in-place.** A real
  ``edit_message`` API requires per-gateway support and a way to
  surface the upstream message id back to the agent loop. We start
  with the channel-portable strategy (multiple short sends) and let
  per-gateway adapters opt into edit-mode in a later release. Microsoft
  Teams / 飞书 / Telegram all support it; 微信公众号 do
  not.

* **Best-effort dispatch.** If the gateway raises while we're trying
  to flush a partial chunk, the failure is logged and **swallowed** —
  the surrounding LLM call must keep running so the user still gets a
  final answer (which the agent loop will fall back to dispatching as
  one big message). Streaming is a "nice to have", never a hard
  dependency.

* **Idempotent finalize.** ``finalize()`` is safe to call multiple
  times; subsequent calls become no-ops. The agent loop calls it from
  the success path AND from the exception/cancel path so we never lose
  a buffered tail.

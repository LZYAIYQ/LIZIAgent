"""Realtime travel triggers used by :mod:`backend.agent.loop`.

Extracted to keep the AgentLoop module focused on
orchestration. These helpers are pure functions over the raw user
text — no dependency on AgentLoop state — so they live as
module-level callables and are re-exported from ``loop.py`` for
backward compatibility with smoke tests that import them directly.

The triggers split into three complementary mechanisms:

* ``_REALTIME_TRAVEL_MARKERS`` — substring tokens like ``火车票`` /
  ``天气`` that unambiguously call for live data, regardless of
  whether the user named cities.
* ``_REALTIME_TRAVEL_ROUTE_RE`` — a city-pair pattern like
  ``北京到上海`` / ``上海→北京``. We deliberately do NOT include
  ``去`` as a connective because it is too overloaded
  (``帮我去查询`` / ``我们去吃饭``) and would create false
  positives that confuse the routing.
* ``_NON_TRAVEL_BLOCKERS`` — a negative-context list. The route
  regex is permissive enough to match ``加入到我的知识库`` or
  ``保存到笔记`` as if they were city pairs. When any blocker
  appears anywhere in the text we refuse the route-pattern path
  (markers still fire on their own — they're far more specific).

# marker list trimmed. The old set included ``\u5b9e\u65f6``
# (realtime), ``\u6e29\u5ea6`` (temperature), ``\u5bfc\u822a``
# (navigation), ``\u5730\u56fe`` (map) and ``\u9644\u8fd1`` (nearby),
# all of which routinely appear in non-travel contexts (``CPU
# \u6e29\u5ea6``, ``\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u822a``, ``\u5b9e\u65f6\u540c

# \u7801``). Substring matching them caused the deterministic prefetch
# path to short-circuit non-travel turns and dispatch a misleading
# ``\ud83d\udd0d \u6b63\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u65f6\u65c5\u884c\u6570
# \u636e`` hint -- see issue logged in v0.40.7. Travel queries that
# legitimately use those words also carry stronger signals (city names
# via the route regex, or specific markers like ``12306`` / ``\u706b
# \u8f66\u7968`` / ``\u822a\u73ed``), so removing the weak tokens from
# the deterministic path has no false-negative impact in practice;
# the LLM can still load the travel skill body via substring trigger.
